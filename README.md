# Keep Me Online Fiverr : Script that will keep you online on your fiverr accounts

Many people work as a freelancer/independent contractor on fiverr. It is very important for the freelancers to stay online so that when a buyer,
client visits their profiles the clients contact him/her seeing online.

But the path to Mecca is always stony. You open your browser and log in to fiverr and do not close the window so that whenever someone messages you 
get instant notification and clients also see you online. But as I said the path to Mecca is always stony and here it is not Mecca but a earthly matter for earning money.
Things are also rough in this case because none want to see you rich. So, what we do? We refresh our page every five minutes! Ah, yes. No, no, here is my script to relieve you from the pain.

Just copy the javascript content and go to the tab where you have fiverr opened, open dev tool or browser console, paste the js content, press enter! Boom! Now, go get some sleep!

Some people may ask why I did not create a browser extension? My Ans: Let's make life more simpler!
Why not just an iframe inside a localhost/file-from-disk-html? Ans: Cross site scripting forgery!
Why not more standalone approach? My ans: none is paying me for this and I am doing and releasing it for the betterment of people. So, learn to be happy with a very good free staff and learn to press CTRL two times and C one time, V one time, Enter one time! And it's not such a thing that sould be more standalone!
